## Overview
Analyze the relationship between academic/scientific topics and their corresponding Wikipedia URLs. For each pair, determine how the topic relates to the content of the linked Wikipedia page.

## Instructions
For each topic-URL pair in the table, respond with one of the following codes:

- **SS**: If the first topic is a subset of the topic covered by the URL
  - Example: "Photochemical reaction" → "Organic photochemistry" (SS)
  - Reasoning: "Photochemical reaction" is a specific concept within the broader field of "Organic photochemistry"

- **S**: If the topic of the URL is a subset of the first topic
  - Example: "Digital system" → "Digital electronics" (S)
  - Reasoning: "Digital electronics" is a specific area within the broader concept of "Digital systems"

- **/**: If you're not sure about the relationship
  - Example: "Urine culture" → "Bacteriuria" (/)
  - Reasoning: The relationship isn't immediately clear without domain expertise

- **y**: If the link matches directly with the topic
  - Example: "Black body radiation" → "Black-body radiation" (y)
  - Reasoning: The topic and URL refer to exactly the same concept

- **n**: If the link doesn't match with the topic and is not related
  - Example: When the topic and URL refer to completely different subjects with no meaningful connection

## Format
Only respond with one of these 5 codes (SS, S, /, y, or n) and nothing else.

## Analysis Process
1. Look at the first topic and understand its scope
2. Examine the URL destination's subject matter
3. Determine the hierarchical relationship between them
4. Apply the appropriate code based on the relationship
5. Continue until all pairs have been analyzed

The goal is to accurately categorize the relationship between specialized academic topics and their corresponding Wikipedia reference pages to understand their taxonomic relationship.
